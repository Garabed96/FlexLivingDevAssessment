2. Manager Dashboard
- Build a user-friendly, modern dashboard interface.
- The dashboard should allow managers to:
- See per-property performance
- Filter or sort by rating, category, channel, or time
- Spot trends or recurring issues
- Select which reviews should be displayed on the public website
- Use your judgment to design a clean and intuitive UI. Think like a product manager
